# iso-639-2.js

This ISO 639-2 language library works in NodeJS and modern browsers.  It allows you to get a list of all languages, sorted by alpha-3 code, alpha-2, native name, English name, or reading direction.  You can look up a language by the alpha-3 or alpha-2 code.  It supports all 486 languages listed on the [official Library of Congress web page](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php), as of 14 July 2014.
